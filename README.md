UNH Coding Bootcamp Friend Finder Homework

## FriendFinder

FriendFinder is a friend matching app. Answer the questions and click submit to see who you match up with.

## Instruction

To use FriendFinder, you'll need to start the server. Navigate to the appropriate directory on your machine,
and then use the following command in your terminal to start a node server.

`node server.js`

Once the server has started, it will let you know which PORT it's listening on. Simply open up a web browser and type
the following URL:

`localhost:<PORT>`

Where `<PORT>`is the number of the PORT that the server is listening on. Upon successful load, you will see the home page for
FriendFinder.
